# twittercrawler
This is a data science project for the mining of tweets containing the famous trend BERGER TO AJAH, using tweeter APIs. The programs were written in RStudio IDE. 
I used R notebook to write the programs, both in R and Python programming language.
I couldnt extract much tweets from the R program, so i had to write the prgram using Python, and i was able to extact a considerable number of tweets, which i saved in a csv file
